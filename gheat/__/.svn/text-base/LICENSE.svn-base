The code for generating the heatmap images was originally ported from Ruby 
(under the MIT license):

And in the interest of full disclosure, you should know that this software
incorporates code that was ported from Google's obfuscated JavaScript. This
code is in the gmerc.py module under __/lib/python/site-packages/. Technically 
speaking this is almost certainly a copyright infringement, but the code in 
question is less than the "15-lines" rule of thumb often employed in matters of 
code borrowing.
